# CryptoDash

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Index](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The project was created as part of my portfolio and not more. The codebase is being covered next things:

1. Modern React Development with React & React Context API for State Management
2. Build a Complete CryptoCurrency Financial Reporting App
3. Styled-components v4 : Dynamic CSS-in-JS
4. HighCharts : Graphing Historical Price Data
5. CSS Grid : Responsive Layouts
6. CryptoCompare API : Fetch Real Pricing Data
7. Moment : Date Manipulation
8. Lodash : Functional Programming
9. Create-React-App 2.0 : Boilerplate Quickly
10. localStorage : Save Coins

It's simple dashboard that has two pages and no external routing.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
